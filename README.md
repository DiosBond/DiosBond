# Hi there :metal:

### My very own personal website :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. Basically this is just a r√©sum√©.

*In my mind, in my head,
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we shared,
This is what we're waiting for
And this is what I'm waiting for
Waiting, waiting, waiting
And this is what I'm waiting for
And this is what I'm waiting for
In my mind, in my head,
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we shared,
This is what we're waiting for
And this is what I'm waiting for
In my mind, in my head,
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we shared,
This is what we're waiting for
And this is what I'm waiting for
In my mind, in my head,
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we shared,
This is what we're waiting for
And this is what I'm waiting for*
